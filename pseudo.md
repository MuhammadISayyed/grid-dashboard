# Grid Dashboard

1. Create a grid layout with 2 columns, one as a sidebar and the other as the main content.
2. Create dummy content for the side bar and the content sections.
3. Build the main layout with CSS Grid.
   1. The sidebar takes the left column and it's smaller than the other one that's taken by the main content.
